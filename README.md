Code for PNAS Paper "Epidemic Responses Under Uncertainty" by Michael Barnett, Greg Buchak, and Constantine Yannelis.

To derive the numerical results in the paper, there are three sets of code that need to be run:
1. Outside-the-Model Uncertainty Code
2. Inside-the-Model Uncertainty Code
3. Detection Error Probability Code

This repository contains a folder for each setting. I outline the code provided, as well as details about to run the code and in what order the code needs to be run, in order to allow users to replicate the results provided in the paper.

1. Outside-the-Model Uncertainty Code


2. Inside-the-Model Uncertainty Code


3. Detection Error Probability Code
